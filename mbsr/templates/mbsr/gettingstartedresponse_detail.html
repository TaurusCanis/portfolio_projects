            This questionnaire begins your MBSR journey. Recording your responses to these questions and those on the
    practice logs will help ground your practice and learnings in a way that would not be possible if you simply answered
    these questions in your head. In a way, this is the first mindfulness practice: being mindful of your intentions and
    commitment to the process you are about to begin.

            So, first, there is probably something that drew you to this program that made it seem like a good idea. For
            example, you may wake up in the middle of the night with worries and concerns that keep you from getting a good
            night’s sleep, or you may be dealing with health issues, and you’ve heard that mindfulness can help you deal with
            them, or you may have trouble concentrating, or you may simply want to increase your ability to be present and
            fully engaged in life, to accept more fully yourself/others, just as you/they are.

            While there are things you hope that will get better, it is important to recognize positive aspects of yourself,
    because it is these things that form the base for any self-improvement. We tend to take for granted our own core
    strengths, so give yourself a few minutes to reflect on this. For instance, what would a good friend or close family
    member say that they appreciate about you?

            Finding a specific time and place for your half-hour of daily practice is likely to be one of the most difficult
    hurdles, and writing down now when and where you’ll be doing your daily practice will help you to keep your promise
    to yourself to practice each day. People often choose to practice first thing in the morning, before roommates or
    family members are up and about, and others like the evening shortly before bedtime, or just after arriving home
    from work. Precisely when you practice is less important than having a set time and place, a time that you know you
    can practice without having to attend to the telephone or be responsive to others, and a place that is quiet and
    separate from others.

        <div class="block"><strong>When will I practice? (Try to be concrete, e.g., 6:30am M-F, 7:30am Sat/Sun): </strong></div>

            In addition, you will want to allow time each week to prepare for the coming week’s practice by watching that
    week’s videos and/or starting the reading indicated for that week. Since we recommend practicing six days a week,
    you could choose to prepare for the coming week on the seventh day, starting at the same time you normally would
    practice. On this day, it’s best to reserve a time period of 60-90 minutes.
